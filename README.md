# Introduction

The main motivation of the action is to be able to publish the vulnerabilities
found during Clair's analysis in the workflow itself as a job part to have the
report available before uploading it to Harbor.

## Build

```bash
# Install the dependencies  
$ npm install

# Build the typescript and package it for distribution
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## Test

```bash
# Run the tests, use to debug, and test it out
$ npm test
```

## Lint

```bash

# Verify lint is happy
$ npm run lint -- --fix
```

For the markdown file

```bash

npm install -g markdownlint-cli@0.25.0

markdownlint '**/*.md' -c .github/config/lint-config.yml
markdown-link-check '**/*.md' -c .github/config/mlc_config.json
```

# Examples

## Restrictions

- Only publish 50 annotations.
- Only parsers json file.

## By Default

By default, it always ends with status success even if it finds vulnerabilities
with criticality higher than High.

```yaml
- name: Publish Scan Report
  uses: santander-group/publish-clair-report@v1
  if: always() # always run even if the previous step fails
  with:
    report_paths: assets/clair-report/ubuntu*.json
```

Must publish the result in another job called `Clair Scan Report` with status
`success` even if there are vulnerabilities, look that Only gets high
vulberabilities.

## Finish with status Failed

By default, it always ends with status success even if it finds vulnerabilities
with criticality higher than High. If we want to indicate the failed state of
the analysis we must mark true the condition `fail_with_vulnerabilities`

```yaml
- name: Publish Scan Report
  uses: santander-group/publish-clair-report@v1
  if: always() # always run even if the previous step fails
  with:
    report_paths: assets/clair-report/ubuntu*.json
    fail_with_vulnerabilities: 'true'
    check_name: ' ðŸ“„  Results Clair Scan'
    summary: 'Results Clair Scan for image ubuntu-14.04.local'
    severity_level: 'Medium'
```

![Override](assets/img/fail_with_vulnerabilities.png)

## Scan File is required and must be exited

By default the job isn't fail even there isn't scan file.

```yaml
  - name: Publish Clair Scan
    uses: santander-group/publish-clair-report@v1
    with:
      report_paths: assets/clair-report/notExists.json
```

![Scan File is Required](assets/img/require_scans_false.png)

If we want that finishes with errors

```yaml
  - name: Publish Clair Scan
    uses: santander-group/publish-clair-report@v1
    with:
      report_paths: assets/clair-report/notExists.json
      require_scans: true
```

![Scan File is Required](assets/img/scan_required.png)

## Publish Summary if not founds vulnerabilities with the severity level

By default, if we do not found vulnerabilities associated with the severity
level or higher, we don't publish the Summary. We only print it at
the console.

![Publish Summary By default](assets/img/publish_summary_false.png)

If we want publish on annotations

```yaml
  - name: Publish Clair Scan
    uses: santander-group/publish-clair-report@v1
    with:
      report_paths: assets/clair-report/without-securityLevel-vulnerabilities.json
      publish_summary: 'true'
      severity_level: 'High'
```
